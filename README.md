# Viper

Simple remake of the classic game snake.

## How to run
The project requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Alternatively, one can also install uv locally via
[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) by running ```mise install```. Then install the dependencies and run the game as follows:

```shell
uv sync
uv run python viper.py
```
